# HW2---Basic-Personal-Portfolio-
Overall objective: Created a personal portfolio from scratch. I will be adding to this site as the bootcamp progresses. 

Per the assignment's read me, it contains the following:
- Header with my name
- Links in the nav bar to sections with my work, an about me, and a contact section. 
- The portfolio section has titled images of future projects (placeholder images and titles for now), and the title of the project appears when the user hovers over the project image.
- When the site is resized, it is responsive, and the grid of portfolio projects resizes and regroups to avoid the boxes being smashed togeher.  


# Notes
- For the banner's image slideshow, I used copy and pasted code from the section "Example of creating a slideshow with pure CSS": https://www.w3docs.com/snippets/css/how-to-create-an-image-slider-or-slideshow.html
    - The code is modified a bit for sizing, and I know the images look wonky because they're too big, but I wanted to try to make a slideshow banner because I like them on other sites. I'm sure there's an easier way once I learn javascript. 

- I successfully made a "sticky" nav bar, but it took a long time to figure out how to keep the elements below from going behind it. Eventually I settled on just using padding-top on the element blow (.slide), but wondering if there's a way this can automatically be done.
